        <li style="margin: 0 0 10px 0">9:00 - 9:25:
          <strong>Non-neutrality & the effect of colonialism on
            librarianship: Cases in Globalization, ICTs, and
            international librarianship</strong> <br /> Mark Shane-Scale<br />
          <br />Abstract: My presentation questions the assumptions of non-neutrality in the knowledge shared by libraries and the mechanisms through which access to global information is provided. Applying Nettleford’s (2003) analysis, I examine the effect of colonialism on libraries and on modern ICT initiatives.<br /></li>
        <li style="margin: 0 0 10px 0">9:25 - 9:50: <strong>OCLC and
            WorldCat: consolidation and monopolization of a core library
            service</strong> <br /> Kris Joseph<br />
          <br />Abstract: Economic forces have encouraged libraries to
          collaborate on shared services, but it can be argued that the
          OCLC’s current operations are monopolistic and ripe for
          disruption. This presentation examines the creation, growth,
          and subsequent domination of OCLC and the WorldCat catalog
          through an application of Tim Wu’s (2010) model of the
          innovation cycle.<br /></li>
        <li style="margin: 0 0 10px 0">9:50 - 10:15: <strong>“Repressed
            desire”: social responsibility and the neoliberal turn</strong> <br /> Sam Popowich<br />
          <br />Abstract: The late 1960s saw a radical transformation of the mode of capitalist accumulation. Theorizing this transition offers new insights into the social responsibility in libraries debates of the period.<br /></li>
        <li style="margin: 0 0 10px 0">10:15 - 10:30: 15-minute break<br /></li>
        <li style="margin: 0 0 10px 0">10:30 - 10:55: <strong>Collective
            agreements and the freedom for librarians to research</strong> <br /> Maureen Babb<br />
          <br />Abstract: The ability to conduct and disseminate research on any topic, even a politically sensitive one, is a component of academic freedom.   The collective agreements, which govern the rights and responsibilities of librarians, of twelve Canadian universities were examined to determine the state of academic freedom and the expectations and provisions for research at these institutions.<br /></li>
        <li style="margin: 0 0 10px 0">10:55 - 11:15: <strong>Fairly
            slippery: the political use, abuse, and misuse of “fair
            dealing” in Canadian opinion journalism, 2016-2017</strong> <br /> Corinne Gilroy<br />
          <br />Abstract: This presentation will examine political uses of the legal term “fair dealing” by various copyright stakeholders in Canada. In order to illustrate the limits and contours of various communities, “fair dealing” will be approached less as a signifier than as a boundary object.<br /></li>
        <li style="margin: 0 0 10px 0">11:15 - 11:40 <strong>Invested
            and invisible identities: politics of language in libraries</strong> <br /> Ean Henninger<br />
          <br />Abstract: Although they often go unexamined, linguistic acts constitute political behavior and shape the potential for engaging in such behavior both inside and outside of libraries. By drawing on work in applied linguistics and making specific reference to ideologies about neoliberalism and multilingualism, this presentation will explore how critical approaches to language practices can help library workers increase investment both in their organizations and in broader political activity.<br /></li>
        <li style="margin: 0 0 10px 0">11:40 - 12:05: <strong>The
            political economy of the research library: on chattel and rent</strong> <br /> Adam Siegel<br />
          <br />Abstract: A review of the history of the modern (i.e., post-Renaissance) research library is instructive: by reviewing and confronting their own history, concentrating in particular on early modern modes of collecting, organizing, describing, and using information (i.e., "primitive accumulation"), libraries gain an heuristic to improve service to research communities within the confines of current copyright and intellectual property law.  Argued in closing that libraries must resume limiting contractual obligations vis-a-vis vendors by regarding them as sellers of chattel goods rather than rentier service providers.<br /></li>
        <li style="margin: 0 0 10px 0">12:05 - 1:15: Lunch<br /></li>
        <li style="margin: 0 0 10px 0">1:15 - 1:40: <strong>A look into
            closed access capitalism and LIS publishing practices</strong> <br /> Robyn Hall<br />
          <br />Abstract: Drawing on data from an investigation of 127 academic, peer-reviewed journals in library and information science (LIS), this presentation will discuss ways that those working in LIS can take back control over how their work is disseminated and shared online. For this to happen, however, members of the profession need to recognize and consciously grapple with the ubiquitous capitalist system that informs so many of the services, functions, and expectations that are tied to the profession.<br /></li>
        <li style="margin: 0 0 10px 0">1:40 - 2:05: <strong>The library
            as market</strong> <br /> Nailisa Tanner<br />
          <br />Abstract: “The marketplace of Ideas” is frequently invoked in debates concerning the merits of free, unrestricted speech; as social and information centres of their communities, libraries are frequently implicated in these debates. This presentation contextualizes the phrase in liberal and neoliberal political thought, and considers what is at stake in using this metaphor as speech becomes marketized in an ever more literal sense.<br /></li>

                      concerns, and you feel comfortable speaking with
                      the offender, please inform the offender that
                      he/she/ze has affected you negatively. Oftentimes,
                      the offending behavior is unintentional, and the
                      accidental offender and offended will resolve the
                      incident by having that initial discussion.</p>

                      <p><em>Politics of Libraries</em> recognizes that there are many reasons
                      speaking directly to the offender may not be
                      workable for you. If you don't feel comfortable
                      speaking directly with the offender for any
                      reason, skip straight to step 2.</p>

                      <p><em>2. Escalation</em></p>
                      <p>If the offender insists that he/she/ze did not
                      offend, if offender is actively harassing you, or
                      if direct engagement is not a good option for you
                      at this time, then you will need a third party to
                      step in. At the <em>Politics of Libraries</em>
                      conference, if you need any assistance with
                      respect to harassment, please contact Amanda
                      Larsen. The full organizing committee will
                      introduce themselves at the beginning of the
                      conference so you know who we are. If you require any assistance with
                      respect to harassment, please find Amanda or
                      any of the other
                      organizers, and they will be able to help you.</p>

                      <p><strong>Sanctions</strong></p>


                      <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior
                      are expected to comply immediately. If a
                      participant engages in harassing behavior,
                      organizers may take any action they deem
                      appropriate, including warning the offender,
                      expulsion from the event.</p>

                      <p>We value everyone's participation in the
                      conference, and will all work to keep the
                      conference a
                      safe and friendly space for all participants!</p>
